Salt Lake O.C.Tanner Meetup

Understand the problem, outputs, tests. Solidify by explaining the 
problem to someone else. Illustrate paths (arrows, circles)
Avoid temptation to just code, and instead come up with a plan.

Check an Array for Even Nubmers
1. Check to make sure input is an array.
2. Create a coutner variable.
3. Loop through the array
4. Check to tsee if the item in the array is actually a number. If not, Ignore it?
5. Run each number through this formula => n % 2
6. Check if the result is zero, if it is, then increment the counter variable.
7. 

Execute the plan.

Can you check the results?
Is there another way to solve the problem?
Can you see a more efficient way?

Data Structures

Are the way we store and retrieve data.
Computers store this data in memory.
The data structure is HOW this data is stored in the computer's memoryl.

Why and How of Data Structures
How much data do you need to store?
How often to you need to access that data?
Do you need access?
Do you need to add data?
